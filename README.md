# Vaccine-Race
Final Project for team V

Authors: Brittany Atkinson, Daniel Parker

## Introduction
This document was designed with the intention of detailing the gameplay of the application Vaccine Race. This document's ideas are based on those of its creators with inspiration from the previously known Flappy Bird mobile device application. 

## Main Premise
The main premise of Vaccine Race is to create a fun 2D multiplayer, that allows up to 4 players to race to spread Corona! This game is designed to be fun, addictive, and competitive as players race & dodge obstacles through the body to see who can reach the final level.

## Game Structure
The players will be inside a blood vessel traveling along a straight path lined with blood clots and white blood cells that players will have to avoid.This path also spawns coins for the players to collect. If players hit the obstacles, their game is over. If the players reach the checkpoint, they are granted extra coins and the level increases in difficulty until the final level. 
 
## Players
This mobile game will work with one to four players at once. If multiple people are playing, the game will be hosted by one player and other others will connect to the host. If it is a single player, then they can immediately start the game.

## Action
The player will be tasked with jumping through narrow obstacles and avoiding being hit by anything other than coins. The screen will move forward at a consistent rate and the player will only have to tap to jump.

## Objective
The main goal is to avoid colliding with anything, collect coins, and attempt to make it as far as possible. If it is multiplayer, the goal is to make it further than the other people, while also collecting coins. The player who survives the longest wins.

## Graphics
It will be a 2D side-scroller with a coronavirus theme. It will be based on a pixel art style.
